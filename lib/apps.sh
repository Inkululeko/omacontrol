# Every application on the machine, and what this desktop has been told to do
# with it. The list is the one the launcher and the Omarchy menu show — the
# visible desktop entries — because three lists of "your apps" that disagree
# are worse than one that is merely long.
#
# Nothing here is a setting. What the page shows about an application is set
# on the pages that own it (a workspace rule on Workspaces, a role on Default
# Apps); this page says what is in force and where to go, and removes the
# application itself. So it polls, like Disk and Processes, and is not in the
# state document: a list of several hundred desktop entries re-read after
# every switch on every other page would be paid for by all of them.

# Which package owns an application, asked one entry at a time.
#
# `pacman -Qo` over four hundred desktop files is seconds; over the one the
# reader has selected it is milliseconds, and the only moment the answer is
# wanted is the moment they ask to remove it.
# Every file that could be this application's entry, nearest first.
#
# Nearest is not the same as owned: an application installed from a package
# often *also* leaves a copy in ~/.local/share/applications — Typora does —
# and that copy belongs to no package. Stopping at the first file found said
# "not owned by a package" about something pacman had installed, so the
# candidates are all offered and the owner is whichever of them a package
# claims.
